# Coffee Tracker Updates - June 16, 2025

## Overview
Major improvements to the Coffee Tracker app focusing on cost analysis improvements, sorting functionality fixes, and coffee amount tracking for accurate cost calculations.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Coffee Amount Tracking with Batch Support ðŸ“Š
**Problem**: Cost calculations used generic amounts (18g for espresso, 30g for cold brew) instead of actual usage.

**Solution**: Added "Coffee Amount (g)" field with batch brewing support for methods like cold brew.

**Implementation**:
- New `coffeeAmount` field in coffee data model
- New `servings` field for batch brewing methods (cold brew)
- Input field added next to Grinder Level in the form
- Cost calculation updated to use actual amount divided by servings for batch methods
- Blue badge display showing "XXg coffee (Y servings)" for cold brew
- Enhanced tooltip showing batch calculation details

**Example**: 90g coffee for 10 servings = 9g per cup cost calculation

**Benefits**:
- Accurate cost per cup calculations for all brewing methods
- Proper batch brewing support (cold brew, French press batches)
- Track variable amounts and batch sizes
- Compare efficiency across different preparation methods

### 2. Enhanced Sorting Functionality ðŸ”„
**Problem**: Price and value sorting didn't work properly due to roaster grouping.

**Solution**: Implemented flat list display for price/value sorting while maintaining grouped view for other sorts.

**Changes**:
- Price sorting (Low to High, High to Low) now shows flat list
- Value sorting shows flat list to properly display best value coffees
- Date, Rating, and Roaster sorting maintain grouped display
- Fixed sort comparison logic for null values
- Improved error handling in calculateValueScore function

### 3. Cost Analysis Improvements ðŸ’°
**Fixes Applied**:
- **Chart Labels**: Fixed Y-axis positioning in cost analysis chart (increased left margin from 60px to 80px)
- **Coffee Names**: Chart now shows full coffee names (Roaster - Description) instead of just brand names
- **Average Price Display**: Added average price per cup next to average rating for each roaster brand

### 4. Cold Brew Support ðŸ§Š
**Added Features**:
- Cold Brew brewing method with proper cost calculations
- Cold brew-specific preparation notes (12/18/24 hour steep times, dilution ratios)
- Higher default coffee amount (30g vs 18g for espresso) when actual amount not specified

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements
**Improvements**:
- Service worker cache version bumped to v2 (fixed 17 vs 25 coffee count issue)
- Better mobile responsiveness in coffee amount display
- Improved badge layout with flex-wrap for grinder level and coffee amount
- Enhanced cost display with usage information in tooltips

## Technical Changes

### Data Model Updates
```javascript
// Added to coffee object
{
  coffeeAmount: '', // Amount of coffee used in grams
  servings: '', // Number of servings/cups this preparation yields
}
```

### Cost Calculation Logic
```javascript
// New logic supports batch brewing with servings
if (coffee.coffeeAmount && !isNaN(parseFloat(coffee.coffeeAmount))) {
  const totalCoffeeAmount = parseFloat(coffee.coffeeAmount);
  
  // For cold brew, if servings specified, calculate per serving
  if (coffee.brewingMethod === 'coldbrew' && coffee.servings && !isNaN(parseFloat(coffee.servings))) {
    gramsPerCup = totalCoffeeAmount / parseFloat(coffee.servings);
  } else {
    gramsPerCup = totalCoffeeAmount;
  }
} else {
  // Use brewing method defaults
  switch(coffee.brewingMethod) {
    case 'coldbrew': gramsPerCup = 30; break;
    case 'espresso': gramsPerCup = 18; break;
    // ... other methods
  }
}
```

### Sorting Implementation
```javascript
// Conditional rendering based on sort type
if (sortBy === 'priceLowHigh' || sortBy === 'priceHighLow' || sortBy === 'value') {
  return flatListView; // Individual coffee cards
} else {
  return groupedView; // Grouped by roaster
}
```

## Files Modified
- `src/App.js` - Main application logic and UI components
- `public/service-worker.js` - Cache version update (v1 â†’ v2)
- `docs/updates-2025-06-16.md` - This documentation file

## Testing Performed
- âœ… Coffee amount tracking works correctly
- âœ… Cost calculations use actual amounts when specified
- âœ… Sorting by price/value shows proper order
- âœ… Chart labels display correctly
- âœ… Service worker cache refresh works
- âœ… All 25 coffees now display properly
- âœ… Cold brew cost calculations accurate

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible with existing data.

## Future Improvements
- Analytics on coffee amount usage patterns
- Brewing ratio recommendations based on method
- Cost efficiency analysis by coffee amount variations
- Export functionality to include coffee amounts

## Performance Impact
- Minimal bundle size increase (+193B)
- No significant performance degradation
- Improved caching with service worker v2

## Deployment
- Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages
- All features tested and working in production
- Cache automatically refreshes for existing users
