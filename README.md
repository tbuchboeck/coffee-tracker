## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd coffee-tracker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. (Optional) Set up cloud database:
   - See [CLOUD_SETUP.md](CLOUD_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions
   - Create a free Supabase account and configure `.env` file
   - Without cloud setup, the app works with localStorage

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

- Toggle the "Favorites" filter to show only starred coffees
- Use the sort dropdown to organize by date, rating, or roaster

## Data Model

Each coffee entry contains:
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  roaster: string,
  description: string,
  favorite: boolean,
  grinded: boolean,
  grindingTime: string,
  grindingDegree: string,
  percentArabica: number,
  percentRobusta: number,
  cuppingTime: Date,
  cremaRating: number (0-5),
  tasteRating: number (0-5),
  tasteNotes: string,
  url: string,
  comment: string,
  origin: string (comma-separated country codes),
  roastLevel: string ('light'|'medium'|'medium-dark'|'dark')
}
```

## Flavor Profile Analysis

The app automatically analyzes taste notes to generate flavor profiles with 8 dimensions:
- Chocolate
- Nutty
- Fruity
- Floral
- Earthy
- Spicy
- Sweet
- Acidic

## Sample Data

The application comes pre-loaded with 25 coffee samples from various roasters including:
- DieR√∂ster
- Lavazza
- 220 Grad
- Bohnendealer
- Dallmayr
- And more...

## Data Persistence

### Cloud Database (Recommended)
With Supabase configured, your data is stored in the cloud:
- ‚úÖ **Sync across devices**: Access from any browser
- ‚úÖ **Automatic backups**: Data safely stored in PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ **No size limits**: Much larger than localStorage (500MB free tier)
- ‚úÖ **Always available**: Survives browser data clearing
- ‚úÖ **Free**: No credit card required
- üü¢ **Status indicator**: Green cloud icon when active

See [CLOUD_SETUP.md](CLOUD_SETUP.md) for setup instructions.

### Local Storage (Fallback)
Without cloud setup, the app uses browser localStorage:
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Dark mode preference is also saved
- No server or account required
- Data is stored locally on your device
- Limited to 5-10MB depending on browser
- ‚ö™ **Status indicator**: Gray cloud icon when active

### Migration Tool
Built-in tool to move localStorage data to cloud:
1. Click the cloud icon in the header
2. Click "Migrate localStorage to Cloud"
3. Your existing data uploads to Supabase
4. Future changes sync automatically

### Export/Import
- **Export**: Click the download button (‚Üì) in the header to save your collection as a JSON file
- **Import**: Click the upload button (‚Üë) to load a previously exported collection
- Import options:
  - Replace: Completely replace current data with imported data
  - Merge: Add imported coffees to your existing collection
- Works with both cloud and localStorage

### Backup Recommendations
- Regularly export your data to create backups (even with cloud)
- Exported files include:
  - All coffee entries with complete data
  - Export version for compatibility
  - Export date for reference

## Limitations

### With Cloud Database (Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Current setup allows anyone with credentials to access data (can be improved with Supabase Auth)
- **No Sharing**: Cannot share collections with other users (yet)

### With localStorage Only
- **Browser-Specific**: Data tied to specific browser and device
- **Storage Limits**: 5-10MB limit depending on browser
- **No Sync**: Data doesn't sync across devices
- **Data Loss Risk**: Cleared if browser data is deleted

### General
- **No User Accounts**: Single-user application (can be added with Supabase Auth)
- **No Photos**: Cannot upload images of coffee bags (yet)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the application:
- ‚úÖ ~~Add cloud storage/sync capabilities~~ (Completed - Supabase integration)
- Add user authentication (Supabase Auth)
- Implement CSV export format
- Add photo upload for coffee bags
- Create shareable coffee profiles
- Add multi-user support with privacy controls
- Implement coffee bean inventory management
- Add data visualization for export statistics
- Implement automatic backup reminders
- Add mobile app version (React Native)
